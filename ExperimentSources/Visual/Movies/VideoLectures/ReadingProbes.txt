?Just now, what were you thinking about?
-What I had to do in the task just now \n    (like what the text was saying).
-Something else happening just now \n    (like the scanner sounds).
-Something else about the task \n    (like something you read earlier).
-Something else entirely \n    (like what you had for breakfast).
-I was asleep.
